Welcome to the G7_lunch !

Just add your name and what you want to bring.

You may want to cook a dish, bake a treat, or just buy something.
Some ideas: bread and butter, sliced meat and cheese, rice dish, noodle dish, salad, quiche, cake, cupcakes, etc... try not to duplicate what someone else is bringing. (And remember: to bring what you may need to serve it with as not sure if our shared kitchen has an unlimited supply of utensils, etc).

We were thinking eating on level 2 is easier (heat your dish before coming down if necessary).

Bring your own plate or container to eat from and own cutlery (letâ€™s be eco friendly! ðŸ˜‹)
